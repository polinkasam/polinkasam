# boundary-check.sh — PreToolUse hook for environment isolation
# Receives tool input JSON on stdin from Claude Code.
# Exit 0 = allow, exit 2 = block (reason on stderr).
# Must be fast (<50ms) — no network calls, just path checks.
#
# Two-tier model (decided 2026-07-08, harvest-2026-07-08-boundary-hook-refinement):
#   HARD tier — paths of other Egregore instances (denied_paths): denied for
#               every tool, always. No consent path exists.
#   SOFT tier — everything else outside the boundary: consent-gated for every
#               tool. Grants live in .egregore-boundary-consent (session-scoped,
#               cleared by session-start) or in config read roots.
# Posture (strict|standard|open), lock, and read roots are merged at session
# start from egregore.json .boundary + .egregore-boundary.local.json into the
# cached boundary JSON. Sessions running with permission_mode=bypassPermissions
# skip the soft tier (never the hard tier) unless the org boundary is locked.

# No set -e — hook must never accidentally block by crashing
# If anything fails unexpectedly, fall through to exit 0 (allow)
