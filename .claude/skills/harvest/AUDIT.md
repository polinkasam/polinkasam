# Harvest — Audit & Rebuild Spec

> Harvest is a general elicitation primitive. It helps an agent ask better
> situated questions and turn the answers into organizationally usable context.
> It is not a survey engine, not a Spiral subroutine, and not a fixed
> interview template.

This document is the persistent design contract for `/harvest`. It was
written as the input that drove the rebuild of `.claude/skills/harvest/SKILL.md`
and the authoring of the sibling docs `PROCESS.md` and `FORMAT.md` — and now
continues to serve as the spec they implement. §13 is the historical record
of the rollout that landed this layout; the rest of the document is current.

---

## 1. Status before the rebuild

(Snapshot of the pre-rebuild state, kept here as the audit findings this
document was written to address. The rebuild — split into PROCESS.md /
FORMAT.md / a thin SKILL.md — landed alongside this audit.)

**Pre-rebuild file**: `.claude/skills/harvest/SKILL.md` (145 lines).
- Procedural Steps 0–6 with graph plumbing
- Connected-mode ops wired: `create-harvest`, `create-harvest-session`,
  `record-harvest-turn`, `complete-harvest` (all in `bin/graph-op.sh`)
- Step 4 said "Apply `skills/harvest/SKILL.md` from here" — but that path
  resolved back to the same file. There was no separate cognitive layer; the
  reference was recursive/self-referential. The file existed; the intended
  layer did not. PROCESS.md / FORMAT.md now provide that layer.

**Reference material (not a port target)**:
The prior harvest spec drafted in the spiral-skill workspace (215 lines)
had drifted toward claim-stress-testing objectives that don't belong in
harvest. We do **not** port it wholesale. We extract only the six reusable
elicitation moves it documents well:

- seed context
- generate situated questions
- evaluate answers
- checkpoint
- cascade carefully
- synthesize with evidence

Everything else — including any framing about "taking a stance,"
"recommending a direction," or treating divergence as something to be
resolved — belongs to Spiral, not Harvest. `PROCESS.md` is authored fresh
from this `AUDIT.md`, with the old spec consulted only as a craft library
for the six moves above.

**Aspirational outputs (gold fixtures)**:
- `memory/knowledge/harvests/2026-03-23-olivier-harvest-analysis.md`
- `memory/knowledge/harvests/2026-03-23-egregore-collective-intelligence-uniqueness.md`
- `memory/handoffs/2026-05/06-cem-harvest-oz-canvas-tech-and-capabilities.md`

These already exemplify the layered output shape (quote ▸ context ▸ reflection
▸ pattern ▸ action). The product knows what good looks like; the work is
making the command reliably reproduce it without the operator carrying the
form.

---

## 2. Primitive boundary

| Primitive | Core move | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Harvest** | Elicit latent human/agent context | task + roles + seed context | positions, preferences, tensions, quotes, decision surfaces |
| **Spiral** | Stress-test a claim | claim + context | refined claim, objections, surviving structure |

Spiral can consume harvest output or trigger a harvest. Harvest is broader:
context, preference, position, domain knowledge, alignment, stakeholder
needs, design taste, team memory. Spiral is pressure-testing claims. Harvest
is eliciting what people know, prefer, feel tension around, or are implicitly
carrying.

**Term hygiene.** Outside this section, `PROCESS.md`, `FORMAT.md`, and
`SKILL.md` should not use Spiral vocabulary — *claim*, *stress-test*,
*objection*, *survives critique*, *recommend a direction*, *take a stance*.
A short boundary section in `PROCESS.md` may name Spiral once to mark the
boundary; everywhere else, harvest stays in its own register: elicit,
preserve, situate, surface, interpret-with-evidence.

**What harvest is not**: a survey, a retrospective form, a performance
review, a structured-field data collector, a replacement for conversation,
a Spiral subroutine.

---

## 3. First-class design constraints

### 3.1 Model-led, not flowchart-led

> The model owns the next question. The protocol only requires that it can
> explain why the question is being asked, preserve the answer, and update
> its interpretation.

The spec defines invariants, affordances, and failure modes — not a rigid
interview script. There is no fixed round count, no fixed question count
per round, no required dimensions to cover. The model reads the situation,
generates the next question with an articulable purpose, evaluates the
answer, and decides whether to deepen, pivot, checkpoint, cascade, or
synthesize.

### 3.2 Primitive-level, not Spiral-specific

Harvest is the elicitation primitive. Anything that needs latent human or
agent context — onboarding, alignment, decision crystallization, knowledge
extraction, retrospective — can call harvest. Spiral, `/quest`, `/reflect`,
and `/onboarding` may consume harvest output. Harvest does not depend on any
of them.

### 3.3 Invariants

Normative in `PROCESS.md` §2 (five invariants: no hidden role
stereotyping · no survey collapse · no unmarked cascade contamination ·
no synthesis without evidence · articulable `questionIntent` per
question). This document does not restate them; the original audit text
lives in git history.

### 3.4 Anti-conflation test

Normative in `PROCESS.md` §8 (the four fixtures every protocol rule
must pass). Not restated here.

### 3.5 Failure modes to design against

| Failure mode | What it looks like | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **Survey collapse** | Structured-question options bias answers; nuance flattens to picked labels | Options drawn from context; freeform escape hatch always; questions can be open-ended where structured choices would constrain |
| **Role calcification** | Inferred role becomes stereotype; respondent can't see or correct it | RoleSheet shows evidence + confidence; low-confidence inferences are surfaced into the question itself |
| **Cascade contamination** | Later respondents over-shaped by earlier ones | Disclosure mode (blind/disclosed/comparative) is chosen per harvest, recorded on the manifest, and visible to respondents |
| **Script drift** | Protocol becomes a flowchart the model rotely executes | Invariants over procedure; `questionIntent` is mandatory and reviewed; round count and shape are model decisions |

---

## 4. Architecture

Five artifacts under `.claude/skills/harvest/`:

1. **`SKILL.md`** — entry point. Orchestration only: parse args, detect
   mode, create IDs, load the sibling contracts, persist state, exit.
   No cognitive logic.
2. **`PROCESS.md`** — the cognitive protocol. Authored fresh from
   `AUDIT.md`; consult the old harvest spec only for the six reusable
   elicitation moves (seed, generate, evaluate, checkpoint, cascade,
   synthesize). Covers role asymmetry, question round protocol, async bridge,
   and resume.
3. **`QUESTION_PALETTE.md`** — the canonical intent → question move →
   answer shape rubric, conversational-move definitions, and hard bans.
   PROCESS, FORMAT, SKILL, and scroll point here instead of restating it.
4. **`FORMAT.md`** — the synthesis grammar. Layered disclosure rules,
   synthesis blocks, generative emission policy.
5. **Memory contract** — documented markdown shape for manifest, session,
   turn, async question, and synthesis files. Lives in this document
   (§9–§10); not a separate doc.

The current SKILL.md's recursive self-reference ("intelligence lives in
skills/harvest/SKILL.md") is the first thing to remove.

---

## 5. Three-column model: Guidance · Tooling · Discretion

Frame the rebuild not as procedure but as the relationship between what the
spec *prescribes*, what the system *provides*, and what the model *decides*.

| Guidance (model reads, qualitative) | Tooling (system provides, concrete) | Discretion (model decides) |
|---|---|---|
| Role asymmetry — sender vs. receiver | RoleSheet schema and resolution helpers | How much context to include with each question |
| Anti-bias — when to disclose, when to withhold | Ask with a structured question when available and permitted in this session; otherwise ask in plain text (1 interaction/round, headers ≤12 chars when available and permitted in this session) | Round count; question count per round |
| Cascade disclosure choices | `questionIntent` + `evaluation` recorded per turn | Disclosure setting (`context_mode`: blind/disclosed/comparative) |
| Synthesis grammar (layers + blocks) | Async question metadata (`harvest_id`, `harvest_session_id`, `turn`, `context_mode`, `status`) | Which synthesis layers and blocks to emit |
| Failure mode awareness | Markdown/session state (local mode), graph nodes (connected mode) | When to checkpoint, deepen, pivot, synthesize |

---

## 6. RoleSheet — sender/receiver asymmetry

Question generation takes both sheets as input, not just the receiver's.
Self-harvest is the degenerate case where sender == receiver.

```
RoleSheet {
  handle:           string         # e.g. "renc"
  explicit_role:    string?        # from memory/people/{handle}.md frontmatter
  explicit_focus:   string?        # declared current focus / domain
  recent_threads:   [string]       # last-N session topics, quest names
  likely_lenses:    [string]       # inferred analytical orientations
  evidence:         [string]       # paths/quotes that justify each inference
  confidence:       low|med|high   # per implicit field
}
```

**Resolution**:
- *Explicit*: read `memory/people/{handle}.md` frontmatter and prose.
- *Implicit*: read recent handoffs/sessions/quests where this person
  appears. Local mode reads files; connected mode queries the graph.

**Surfacing into the interaction (anti-calcification)**:
- High confidence: the inference shapes the question silently.
- Low/medium confidence: surface the inference into the question itself —
  *"I'm reading you as approaching this from the eng-lead lens — push back
  if that's wrong."* Respondent can correct in one turn.

**Generation input** (per turn):
```
generate_question({
  sender:        SenderSheet,
  receiver:      ReceiverSheet,
  task:          string,
  intent:        string,
  seed:          [Document],
  prior_turns:   [Turn],
  open_threads:  [string],
})
```

The vector matters. `cem-asks-renc-about-pricing` ≠
`renc-asks-cem-about-pricing`. The asymmetry is what lets harvest produce
*situated* questions instead of generic ones.

---

## 7. Question round protocol

Normative in `PROCESS.md` §3.2 (round shape, forbidden-in-round-1,
always-permitted) and §3.3 (evaluation vocabulary). Not restated here.
The unique tooling fact this document owns: the graph supports
`questionIntent` and `evaluation` on `HarvestTurn` (the
`record-harvest-turn` op in `bin/graph-op.sh`). We use what's there.

---

## 8. Synthesis

> **A harvest maps the choices; it need not make them.**

Normative in `FORMAT.md`: the four layers (§2), the six synthesis
blocks (§3), generative emission (§4), and `/reflect`-able linkability
(§8). Not restated here.

---

## 9. Async bridge — extending `/ask` for harvest re-entry

Async harvest doesn't just "deliver via `/ask`." When a respondent isn't
present, harvest emits a question file using `/ask`'s existing markdown
shape, *plus* harvest metadata so the answer re-enters the right harvest:

```yaml
---
from:                cem
to:                  renc
topic:               pricing
status:              pending      # pending | answered | incorporated
date:                2026-05-07

harvest_id:          harvest-2026-05-07-pricing
harvest_session_id:  harvest-2026-05-07-pricing-renc
turn:                3
question_intent:     "Renc's stance on free-tier ceiling vs. wedge"
context_mode:        disclosed    # blind | disclosed | comparative
---

## Questions

1. [Wedge] {generated text}
2. [Ceiling] {generated text}
```

`bin/agent.sh ask` originally wrote only `from / to / topic / status /
created` (the `ask` writer in `bin/agent.sh`). It has been extended (or
`/harvest` writes harvest-flavored question files directly) so the async
bridge is re-entrant.

When the respondent answers via `/ask`, the answers append to the file and
status moves `pending → answered`. The next time `/harvest` runs and finds
its session has `answered` files, it incorporates them, sets status to
`incorporated`, and continues toward synthesis.

**Async initial state**: `create-harvest-session` (in `bin/graph-op.sh`)
accepts an optional 4th `[status]` argument validated against
`pending|active|answered|complete|incorporated` — **this five-value enum
is the canonical HarvestSession status set**; every other mention cites
it. (The question *file's* frontmatter `status` is a different, smaller
enum: `pending|answered|incorporated`.) Async respondents are created
with `pending` and transition to `active` when they engage; default
remains `active` for back-compat with synchronous callers.

---

## 10. Local-mode contract

Local mode never references graph failures. It writes durable markdown.

```
memory/knowledge/harvests/{date}-{slug}/
  manifest.md             # harvest-level: id, topic, intent, initiator,
                          # respondents, disclosure_mode, status
  sessions/
    {handle}.md           # per-respondent: turns inline, frontmatter status
  synthesis.md            # the layered output (L0..L3)
```

For single-session harvests (the common case), the existing flat file at
`memory/knowledge/harvests/{date}-{slug}.md` remains valid — it collapses
manifest + session + synthesis into one. The directory shape is opt-in for
multi-respondent harvests.

`/ask`'s local-mode pattern (in `.claude/skills/ask/SKILL.md`) is the
model to follow: clear local/connected split, no graph-failure messaging
in local mode, durable markdown is the source of truth.

---

## 11. Resume protocol

Normative in `PROCESS.md` §7. Session status uses the §9 enum
(`pending | active | answered | complete | incorporated`). The harvest
is `complete` only when synthesis is written and linked.

---

## 12. Eval fixtures

Pin two harvests as gold:

1. `memory/knowledge/harvests/2026-03-23-olivier-harvest-analysis.md`
2. `memory/handoffs/2026-05/06-cem-harvest-oz-canvas-tech-and-capabilities.md`

Regeneration must reproduce, given the same intent + RoleSheets + seed:

- L0 portrait present, single sentence, names the sharpest finding
- ≥3 named patterns (knowledge / action / antipattern) where the source
  fixture has them
- Direct quotes attributed by handle
- L1 surface populated when divergence or convergence existed; absent
  cleanly when the harvest was pure preference / context
- No leading questions in round 1 (check `questionIntent` log)
- Every L2 assertion traces to a recorded turn or marked seed

These are not unit tests. They are reference outputs the rebuild is judged
against. If the regenerated artifact fails any of these, the rebuild isn't
done.

---

## 13. Rollout (historical record)

The order in which the rebuild landed. Steps 1–7 shipped together; step 8
remains as the empirical proof the rebuild reproduces the gold fixtures.

1. ✓ Land this `AUDIT.md`.
2. ✓ Rewrite `.claude/skills/harvest/SKILL.md` as a real entry point. Move
   cognitive content out.
3. ✓ **Author `PROCESS.md` fresh from this `AUDIT.md`.** Did not port the
   prior spiral-context harvest spec wholesale. Used it only as a craft
   library for the six reusable moves (seed, generate, evaluate,
   checkpoint, cascade, synthesize). Every protocol rule was run through
   the §3.4 anti-conflation test before keeping it. Spiral vocabulary
   stripped except in a short boundary section.
4. ✓ Write `FORMAT.md` from §8 using Olivier + Oz harvests as fixtures.
5. ✓ Document the local-mode markdown contract (§10, this document —
   `PROCESS.md` §9 points here).
6. ✓ `bin/graph-op.sh create-harvest-session` accepts an optional
   `[status]` argument with enum validation (§9).
7. ✓ `bin/agent.sh ask` extended with harvest-flavored frontmatter
   fields per §9 (`--harvest-id`, `--harvest-session-id`, `--turn`,
   `--question-intent`, `--context-mode`).
8. Run regeneration against fixtures (§12). Iterate until all pass.

The Olivier and Oz harvests are the bar. The product already knows what
good looks like; the rebuild is making the command reliably reproduce it
without the operator carrying the form.

---

## 14. Decision surface — rendered mode + round-trip

The `choice` block (`FORMAT.md` §3) gained a **rendered, fillable
form** — the *decision surface*. `/harvest` is the only command: when its findings are decision-shaped, it
renders them as a *decision surface* — the rendered format/artifact the respondent
decides on and pastes back. *Decision surface* names the **format**, not a command;
there is no `/decision-surface` command (everything merges into `/harvest` — one
verb, one grammar).

**Resolution** — matches the original directed-vs-self intent:
- Invoked on yourself (no `--to`) → **self-harvest**, rendered: surface your own
  decisions, fill, paste back into the session.
- Sent to someone (`--to <name>`) → **directed harvest**: render + deliver; their
  filled-in choices return as the answer.

### Renderer

`decision-surface` is a first-class artifact type in `packages/egregore-artifacts`
(`lib/parsers/decision-surface.js`, `lib/templates/decision-surface.js`, registered
in `lib/index.js`; `decision-surface` added to `bin/cli.js` known types). It renders
the data model — `decisions[] → {id, title, context, mode, max, ends, section,
options[{key, label, visual, tradeoffs[{t,text}], recommended}]}` — as an
interactive surface: option cards, a structural visual per option, honest `+/−`
tradeoffs, at most one recommendation, selection state, a progress bar, and a
copy-back button.

**Answer modes (canonical):** `mode ∈ single | multi | rank | weight | spectrum`,
per card. Absent or unknown ⇒ `single` (backward compatibility only — new surfaces
declare a mode explicitly; see SKILL.md's mode table for selection guidance).
Mode-specific fields: `max` (multi — optional selection cap), `ends` (spectrum —
the two labeled poles, `["left","right"]`). **Grouping:** optional top-level
`sections: [{id, label, desc}]` plus `section: "<id>"` per decision renders a
category rail; additive — surfaces without it render flat, unchanged. Locked to the **meridian**
palette by the design-system route. Styled with **role tokens only** (`--t1` decided,
`--t2` plus, `--t3` minus, `--ink/--paper/--line/--card`) — dark-mode-safe, no
resolved hex. The output is fully self-contained (CSS + behavior inlined): fillable
from a file, a published URL, or embedded in an emissary, with **no egregore runtime
needed to fill it** — only to absorb.

### Round-trip — the return contract

The paste-back block is the **transport-agnostic return contract**:

```
#{slug}-decisions:v1
surface: {surface_id}
harvest: {harvest_id}      # directed surfaces only — re-keys to the HarvestSession
source: {source}
date: {YYYY-MM-DD}

Q1 {decision-id}: {option-key}  ("{label}")
   note: {reasoning}
Q2 {decision-id}: UNDECIDED
Q3 {decision-id}: [{key-a}, {key-b}]  ("{Label A}" + "{Label B}")   # multi
Q4 {decision-id}: {key-a} > {key-c} > {key-b}                      # rank
Q5 {decision-id}: {position}  ({left-pole}→{right-pole})           # spectrum
Q6 {decision-id}: {key-a}:60 {key-b}:40                            # weight
```

Each answer mode emits its own Q-line shape (above); `UNDECIDED` and the
indented `note:` are valid under every mode.

This is the same shape already in field use (`#…-decisions:v1`). It self-identifies
the surface/harvest it answers, so it re-keys deterministically over *any* channel.
On `--resume`: re-key, record each choice as a `HarvestTurn` answer (`note` = the
rationale), apply resolved decisions to `source`, log to
`memory/knowledge/decisions/` if others will build on them, synthesize. `UNDECIDED`
stays open — never forced.

### Absorb & review (canonical)

This is the single canonical statement of the rendered-surface absorb
machine. `SKILL.md` points here; scrolls carry their own version of the
same machine in `.claude/skills/scroll/SKILL.md` §5–§6 (shared event
grammar, separate stores).

Rendered decision surfaces have the same durable review substrate as
scrolls. Store the surface's data model next to `source` with optional
`"author": "<person-slug>"` and `"trusted": ["<person-slug>", …]`;
legacy surfaces without `author` are backfilled from unambiguous
artifact/source authorship, otherwise ask once and write it — never
silently default open. Append events to
`memory/harvests/.events/<surface-slug>.jsonl` (the runtime events root,
sibling of scrolls' `memory/scrolls/.events/` — synthesis artifacts live
separately under `memory/knowledge/harvests/`) using the same event
grammar as scrolls: `turn-received`, `turn-reviewed`, and
surface-specific `turn-applied` (there is no `version-published` for
surfaces). A `turn-received` may carry optional
`submitted_by: <person-slug>` event-log metadata recorded only on that
event from the session person doing the paste; it is never projected
into the ledger or return block and is not part of the history
return-block grammar. Event ids are `turn.id`, `review|<turn.id>`, and
`applied|<turn.id>` respectively.

Re-key the pasted return block by `surface`/`harvest` and create its
`turn-received` event. Derive the paster from the session person doing
the paste, not the return block's self-declared `respondent:`
attribution. If the paster is the `author` or in `trusted`, continue the
existing apply flow. Otherwise append the pending turn, do **not** apply
decisions to `source` or log to `memory/knowledge/decisions/`, notify
the author via `bash bin/notify.sh` in connected mode or an addressed
handoff in local mode, and stop. The notification names the surface,
paster, digest, and the same accept / decline-with-required-reason /
synthesize dispositions; the contributor may also send the acknowledged
artifact link directly.

The author disposes in agent chat with the same protocol as scrolls:
accept, decline with a nonblank attributed note, per-answer overrides,
or synthesize all pending turns and approve the proposal. Append each
`turn-reviewed` before applying anything. The hybrid rule is identical:
top-level disposition defaults, `answers` overrides per fork, any
effective accepted answer is absorbable, a zero-answer turn takes the
top-level disposition as its effective disposition, zero is a plain
decline, and a note is required for every effective decline.
Accepted-but-unapplied turns remain pending and are retryable.

For every successful application — whether it follows an accepted review
or a direct author/trusted apply — apply resolved decisions to `source`,
log to `memory/knowledge/decisions/` if others will build on them, and
only **after both steps complete** append `turn-applied` with
`{ "id":"applied|<turn.id>", "type":"turn-applied", "turn":"<turn.id>",
"date":"…", "targets":["<paths written>"] }`. Before re-applying an
accepted turn, check the targets for its turn id (decision records name
the turn id) and skip targets already written for that id; this keeps
retries idempotent. The surface remains pending until `turn-applied`; a
declined review is the only review projection that clears it without
application. Then synthesize. `UNDECIDED` lines stay open — never force
a pick.

### Two transports — one payload

| Transport | For | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Copy-back → harvest channel** | egregore users, local-first | **Built.** Block returns via `/ask`→`/answer`→`/harvest --resume`. Works offline; no server. |
| **Emissary respond (`kind: decision`)** | people **without** egregore who want to pass surfaces back and forth | **Designed, not built.** Carries the *identical* paste-back payload as an emissary response (`packages/egregore-emissary` `respond`, threaded via `parents`). Because the surface and the return contract are transport-agnostic, this is a delivery/return swap — **no renderer rework**. |

**Invariant — transport-neutral:** the renderer and the return contract must stay
transport-neutral. A change that couples the surface or the paste-back block to the
harvest channel specifically (rather than to the abstract "selections + notes,
re-keyed by surface/harvest") breaks the deferred emissary path and must be rejected.

**Invariant — no author markup:** a directed surface is published and sent to other
people, so the renderer must never inject author-supplied HTML/SVG. Visuals use a
closed, structured schema (`mono` token spans, `badges`, `diagram` primitives)
rendered as escaped React elements with allowlisted tones — no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
for any data-derived content. The only `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` permitted is the
static CSS/behavior strings and the config object (`JSON.stringify`, with every
`<` escaped to its unicode form so a malicious value can't break out of the
`</script>` tag), whose values are only ever written back via `textContent`.
Re-introducing a raw-HTML/SVG visual path is a security regression and must be
rejected.

### Rollout (this change)

1. ✓ `decision-surface` renderer added to `packages/egregore-artifacts` (parser,
   template, index + CLI registration), role-token / dark-mode-safe, meridian-locked.
2. ✓ Verified end-to-end (object + JSON-file + markdown-embedded paths) and
   screenshotted in light + dark.
3. ✓ Rendered-surface mode folded into `/harvest` SKILL.md (the only command;
   `decision surface` is the rendered format, not a command — no
   `/decision-surface` command).
4. ✓ `SKILL.md` + `FORMAT.md` updated: rendered mode, absorb-on-resume,
   strategic surface-design guidance, `choice` block promoted to a
   rendered form.
5. ◻ **Deferred:** emissary `kind: decision` + `respond` extension for the
   non-egregore transport.
6. ◻ **Deferred:** publish `egregore-artifacts` with the new type so
   `npx egregore-artifacts decision-surface` resolves (prototype renders via the
   local package). This is a framework change — land it via `/contribute`, not a
   local edit, before relying on the published path.
