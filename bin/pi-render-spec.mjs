Pi loads it through \`.pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.md\` after the launcher grants project trust for this run.

The card ends with **"What are you working on?"** — that question is already on screen; treat the user's first message as the answer to it.

Read the selected skill's \`SKILL.md\` completely before acting. Codex wording inside the shared portable skills means the shell-capable runtime adapter; in Pi, run referenced \`bin/\` scripts directly, use ordinary Pi shell/network access, ignore Codex approval-channel wording, and render compact numbered questions when no Pi UI question surface is available.`, CODEX_COMMAND_LEAD);
