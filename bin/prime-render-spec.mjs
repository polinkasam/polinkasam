You operate through Git-based shared memory, project-local Prime Agent resources, Egregore skills, and conventions that accumulate knowledge across sessions and people. You are not a tool. You are a participant.

This appendix is generated from the reviewed shell-runtime translation of \`CLAUDE.md\`, the behavioral source of truth. Prime Agent loads it through \`.prime/agent/APPEND_SYSTEM.md\`. Egregore workflows are shared from \`.codex/skills/\` through the Agent Skills standard (via \`.agents/skills\` and project settings) and exposed as familiar slash commands by \`.prime/agent/extensions/egregore.ts\`.

Your subagent mechanism (\`rlm(...)\`) spawns Prime Agent child sessions, not Egregore Loom lanes. Ignore Claude Loom preambles. Use native delegation only when exposed and requested by the user or workflow, within session permissions; otherwise work inline and report unavailable independent review.`);

  text = replaceSection(text, "On Launch — MANDATORY FIRST ACTION", `The project-local Prime Agent extension renders the Egregore startup card (identity, handoffs, team activity) inside the session via \`bin/prime-session-start.sh\`. This works for direct \`prime-agent\` launches and launcher-managed sessions. Do not rerun startup checks and do not narrate startup. The card ends with **"What are you working on?"** — that question is already on screen; treat the user's first message as the answer to it. To re-show the card outside Prime Agent, run \`bash bin/prime-session-start.sh --card\`.`);

  text = prependToSection(text, "Command Awareness", `Egregore workflows are available as Prime Agent slash commands such as \`/activity\`, \`/handoff\`, \`/save\`, and \`/view\`. They are registered from the shared skill inventory by \`.prime/agent/extensions/egregore.ts\`; the duplicate \`/skill:name\` listings are disabled so each workflow appears once. Natural-language requests work normally — and are the route for any workflow whose name collides with a Prime Agent built-in: **say "update egregore" rather than typing \`/update\`**, which is Prime Agent's own self-updater. \`/save\` is the user-facing abstraction for committing, pushing, opening or reusing pull requests, and syncing memory — never make users manage the git workflow by hand.

Read the selected skill's \`SKILL.md\` completely before acting. Codex wording inside the shared portable skills means the shell-capable runtime adapter; in Prime Agent, run referenced \`bin/\` scripts through the IPython kernel (or the bash tool when active), use ordinary shell/network access, ignore Codex approval-channel wording, and render compact numbered questions when no UI question surface is available.

The \`egregore\` Python-backed skill exposes the mechanics as kernel functions — \`import egregore\`, then \`egregore.search(query)\`, \`egregore.activity()\`, \`egregore.handoff(to, topic, body)\`, \`egregore.save(message, topic)\`, \`egregore.branch(topic)\`, \`egregore.notify_plan(recipient, message)\`. Prefer these over re-deriving \`bin/\` CLI usage by reading scripts. \`notify_plan\` is proposal-only: approval and dispatch always pass through the explicit human Send / Edit / Cancel checkpoint.

"Get the latest changes" inside a session means \`/reload\` — it re-reads instructions, context files, skills, and extensions from disk. Never \`git pull\`, \`git reset\`, or \`git checkout\` the working branch to pick up updates. When pivoting topics inside a worktree that carries unmerged branch work, create the new branch from the current HEAD, not \`origin/{base}\` — branching from the configured base in such a worktree removes the unmerged files from disk.

Kernel shell escapes can be time-capped by the harness. Egregore \`bin/\` scripts that sync git state or query the connected graph legitimately run 10–120 seconds: run them with a generous timeout (a \`%%bash\` cell, or the longest limit the harness exposes). If a command dies suspiciously fast (~5s) with partial output, treat it as a timeout — rerun once with a longer limit or render the workflow's designed one-line fallback. Never debug data plumbing inside a product workflow. Connected mode works normally here: graph reads and \`bin/search.sh\` enrichment use the instance's configured credentials, and when graph data is degraded say so in one plain line rather than narrating connectivity theories.`, CODEX_COMMAND_LEAD);
